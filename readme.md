# Genshin Impact Quiz App
[Live Website](hhttps://digimori.github.io/MilestoneProjectTwoGenshinQuiz/)
[Github Respository](https://github.com/digimori/MilestoneProjectTwoGenshinQuiz)

This Genshin Impact quiz app is designed to be a short and sweet way of testing a players knowledge of the current in-game lore. 
There are a variety of questions, each one more increasingly difficult than the last. 
When the user clicks "Start Quiz", they will be shown a brief "How to play" box giving the rules and two buttons; One to exit the game and one to continue.
Pressing the Exit Game button will take the user back to the "Start Quiz" page and the "New Game" button will take them to the quiz.
When a user clicks an answer, they will be shown via a red or green overlay on if they are correct or not. They can then hit the "Next question" button to take them to the next question.
Once the end of the questions has been reached, the player will then be met with a results screen which displays how many they got correct and if they would like to try again via a "New Game?" button.

## Features:

### The Start Button:

The first element that a player will encounter upon loading the page is a 'Start Quiz' button. 
The background chosen is the in-game wish screen that every player is familiar with, beit happily or unhappily, depending on your luck. 
I would have liked to have found a better contrasting logo of the game, but it's either this or white, and neither unfortunately are particularly pretty.

### How to Play Box:

Once the start button is clicked, the page will swap to a 'How to play' box, which contains information about the quiz.
On this same box, there are Exit Game and New Game buttons, both with their own functionalit which will be explained below in the Navigation section.
